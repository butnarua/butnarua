ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m **Andrei Butnaru** and this is my GitHub portfolio.

In order to develop myself I did online QA courses, where I learned about **Agile**, **Manual testing**, **API testing using Postman**, writing **Bug reports**, **Test cases** & **Test scenarios** in **Jira** and **Automation testing** using **CypressJS**.

I'm always willing to learn, searching for new things so that I can develop myself. I consider myself organised, ambitious, responsable, serious and I have a strong desire to learn new things and improve my professional career.
